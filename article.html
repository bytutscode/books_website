            <h2>2. The main words in the book are yours.</h2>
            <p>The most important words for your child can only be written by you – his parent. Therefore, do not be
                polished and write
                a couple of offers on a postcard or tab.</p>
            <h3>2.1 What do teenagers think?</h3>
            <p>Adventure novels are interesting primarily for their plot, some intrigue and action. They broaden their
                horizons,
                develop fantasy, some instill a love of history and geography. Many of them also touch on the topic of
                relationships,
                the actions of the main characters lead to reflection, give ground for parallels and certain
                conclusions.</p>
            <h4>What books are worth choosing for teenagers?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>adventure books</li>
                <li>about relationships</li>
                <li>for self-discovery</li>
                <li>fiction and magic</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Self-determination is an important stage that a person goes through at the stage of growing up. For
                adolescents, this
                topic is very relevant, they are looking for themselves, trying to figure out their inner world.</p>
            <h3>2.2 A book as a gift – for or against?</h3>
            <p>The book is the best gift, no doubt. You give not just a bright cover and a couple of hundred pages, but
                whole worlds –
                fascinating and unique! The book can enrich the world of a loved one, make him better and smarter. Solid
                pros!</p>
            <p>Children need to be taught to read from a young age so that they have a great baggage of knowledge and
                developed fantasy
                to school. Give them books that will inspire them and give them the right information in game form.</p>
